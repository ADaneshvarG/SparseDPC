This code showcases the ability of Sparse dictionary control policies, using [Differentiable Predictive Control](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959152422000981) as a method of policy optimization. All code is implemented using [Neuromancer](https://github.com/PNNL/Neuromancer).
